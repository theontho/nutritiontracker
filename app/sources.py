"""Registry of food composition data sources.

Every food record carries a ``source`` code that resolves to an entry here, so
the API can report where a nutrient value came from, under what licence it was
published, and how much to trust it relative to a duplicate from another
source.

Tiers order duplicate foods during search (lower wins):

    0  the user's own deliberate data (custom foods, recipes)
    1  research-grade and gap-filled — missing values imputed by documented
       procedures, so a nutrient profile is essentially complete
    2  laboratory-analysed reference data, authoritative but sparse
    3  compiled reference data, no longer maintained
    4  nutrition-label data — only what the manufacturer prints on the package

Adding a new source (CoFID, CNF, Frida, ...) means adding a row here plus a
normalizer in ``app/providers/``; ``foods.source`` is a foreign key onto this
registry, so no schema migration is required.
