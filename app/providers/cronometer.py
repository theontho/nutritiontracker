"""Normalizer for a personal Cronometer export.

Unlike the other providers in this package, this one does not read a published
national dataset. It reads a *personal data export* — the foods one account
actually logged — produced by crawling Cronometer's own APIs. It exists so that
foods a user has already curated elsewhere can be carried into this system with
their real provenance intact.

Licensing
---------
Cronometer serves foods drawn from several upstream databases, and two of the
largest are **not** openly licensed: NCCDB (University of Minnesota Nutrition
Coordinating Center) and CRDB (Cronometer's own restaurant and branded
database). Importing your own export for your own use is personal use, not
redistribution. The resulting rows must not be republished, redistributed, or
exposed through a public API, and no export data is committed to this
repository.

Layout of an export directory::

    cronometer.sqlite3                     crawl database (diary, referenced foods)
    raw/mobile/food_details/objects/**.json  one JSON document per food

``referenced_items`` records which foods the account actually used, but its
``enriched_json`` is inconsistent: some records are per 100 g while others are
per an unrecorded default serving (butter came out as 103 kcal — one
tablespoon), so scaling them is guesswork. The raw ``food_details`` documents
carry no such ambiguity: every one is per 100 g, keyed by numeric nutrient id,
and 150 nutrient ids were verified to agree exactly with the per-100 g
``enriched_json`` records. Those documents are therefore the only thing read
for nutrient values, and any food lacking one is skipped rather than guessed.

Nutrient ids are USDA SR nutrient numbers (203 protein, 601 cholesterol) with a
handful of Cronometer extensions in the 10000 range.
