"""Normalizer for the Canadian Nutrient File (CNF).

CNF is published by Health Canada under the Open Government Licence - Canada as
a set of relational CSV files rather than one table per food:

    Food_Name.csv                 one row per food
    Nutrient_Name.csv             nutrient code -> symbol, unit
    Nutrient_Amount.csv           one row per (food, nutrient) measurement
    Measure_Weight_Conversion.csv one row per (food, household measure)
    Measure_Name.csv              measure code -> "1 cup (250 ml)"

Because measurements are rows rather than columns, a nutrient a food was never
assayed for simply has no row, which maps cleanly onto None: CNF states what it
measured and stays silent otherwise, so nothing has to be inferred from a zero.

Nutrient codes are the original USDA SR nutrient numbers (203 protein, 601
cholesterol), and amounts are per 100 g of edible portion.
